# A collection of numerical tests using PorePy

This GitHub repository is intended to serve as a collection of numerical tests for problems in saturated-unsaturated fractured deformable porous media.

The test cases are presented in Jupyter Notebooks and are intended to be self-explanatories (at least to a certain degree).

To be able to run the scripts, you should have a Python 3.6 distribution installed in your machine and the latest PorePy realease (see www.github.com/pmgbergen/porepy)
